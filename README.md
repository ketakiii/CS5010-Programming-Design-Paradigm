# Programming-Design-Paradigm

All the labs done in the course of Programming Design Paradigm - focused on Object Oriented Programming in Java. We have explored frameworks like the MVC, Schedulers and Vistors through the labs. Also have made games like a Tic Tac Toe with a model, view and controller architecture. All labs strictly follow the documentation and formatting rules.
